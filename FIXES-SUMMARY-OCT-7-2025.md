# Capital City Contractors - Fixes Summary
**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Session:** Three Critical Issues Resolved

---

## üéØ ISSUES ADDRESSED

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: Duplicate Error Messages (CRITICAL) - RESOLVED

**Problem:**
Quote form displayed TWO identical "This field is required" error messages when clicking on/off required fields.

**Root Cause:**
Multiple validation handlers being attached to the same form fields, causing validation to run twice.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Added class-level flag** (`validationSetup`) to prevent `setupFormValidation()` from running multiple times
2. **Implemented debouncing** (10ms delay) in `showFieldValidation()` to batch rapid validation calls
3. **Stored event handlers** on elements for better tracking and potential cleanup
4. **Enhanced error cleanup** - clears pending timeouts before new validation
5. **Added console logging** for debugging and monitoring

**Files Modified:**
- `assets/js/emailjs-integration.js` (lines 21, 70-94, 130-161, 163-173)

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Click on required fields and click off rapidly
- Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test on mobile devices
- Verify only ONE error message appears per field

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: Inconsistent Discount Messaging - RESOLVED

**Problem:**
"10% discount this week" message in quote form conflicted with "15% discount" promotion shown elsewhere.

**Solution:**
- Removed "10% discount this week" from quote form benefits (line 2870)
- Replaced with "Professional quality guaranteed"
- Now consistent with 15% discount promotion

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` (line 2870)
