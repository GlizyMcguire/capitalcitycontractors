## 🌱 Seed Data

If you start fresh, the CRM creates **3 sample leads** automatically:
- John Smith - Kitchen Reno - Ottawa
- Sarah Johnson - Bathroom Reno - Kanata
- Mike Brown - Interior Painting - Nepean

Each has:
- Random estimated value ($5k-$25k)
- Random lead source
- Random status (New, Qualified, or Estimate Sent)
- Next action scheduled

---

## 🔄 Data Migration

**Old discount form leads automatically migrate!**

If you have existing leads from the discount form:
- Each old lead becomes a Contact + Lead
- Contact gets email consent = true
- Tagged as "migrated"
- Lead status = "new"
- Preserves original timestamps

---

## 🎨 UI/UX

### Design
- Clean, minimal interface
- White background with subtle borders
- Color-coded elements (blue primary, red danger)
- Large, touch-friendly buttons

### Responsive

- Pipeline: 2 columns on mobile
- Modal forms: 90% width on mobile

### Interactions
