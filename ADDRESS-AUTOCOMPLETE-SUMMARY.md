### Before (without autocomplete):
```
[Street Address *]
```
User types entire address manually, possible typos.

### After (with autocomplete):
```
[Start typing your address...]
  ↓ User types "123 ma"
  
  📍 123 Main Street, Ottawa, ON
  📍 123 Maple Avenue, Ottawa, ON
  📍 123 Manor Park Drive, Ottawa, ON
  
  ↓ User selects address
  
[123 Main Street, Ottawa, ON K1A 0A1, Canada] ✅
```
