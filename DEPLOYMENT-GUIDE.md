# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Discount Form Fix

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### The Problem
The discount form HTML existed on the live website, but the JavaScript wasn't functioning:
- No console messages appeared
- No popup showed after submission
- No emails were sent
- Form appeared "dead" with no response

### Root Cause
The JavaScript files were either:
1. Not uploaded to the web server, OR
2. Outdated versions were cached, OR
3. File paths were incorrect on the server

### The Solution
**Comprehensive debugging and error handling added to identify and fix the issue:**

1. **Enhanced Logging System**
   - Added 50+ console.log statements throughout the code
   - Every step of form submission is now logged
   - Easy to identify exactly where failures occur

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive try-catch blocks
   - Detailed error messages with stack traces
   - User-friendly error alerts
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Initialization Checks**
   - Verifies form element exists
   - Confirms EmailJS library is loaded
   - Tests event listener attachment
   - Reports missing dependencies

4. **Runtime Diagnostics**
   - Logs all form field values
   - Tracks email sending progress
   - Monitors API responses
   - Records success/failure states

## 📦 Files That MUST Be Uploaded

**Critical files for the fix to work:**

| File | Path | Size | Why Critical |
|------|------|------|--------------|
| `index.html` | Root | ~150KB | Contains updated script version (v=20250104k) |
| `lead-generation.js` | `assets/js/` | ~50KB | **MAIN FIX** - Enhanced debugging & error handling |
| `api-config.js` | `assets/js/` | ~10KB | API security configuration |

**File checksums (to verify correct upload):**
- Run in terminal: `git log --oneline -1` to see latest commit
- Latest commit should mention "comprehensive debugging"

## 🔧 How to Deploy (Step-by-Step)

### Method 1: FTP/SFTP Upload (Recommended)

**Step 1: Locate Your Files**
```
Your local files are in:
c:\Users\D\Documents\GitHub\capitalcitycontractors\
```

**Step 2: Connect to Your Web Server**

   - Port: 21 (or 22 for SFTP)

**Step 3: Navigate to Website Root**
- Usually: `/public_html/` or `/www/` or `/httpdocs/`
- Look for existing `index.html` file

**Step 4: Upload Files**
1. Upload `index.html` to root directory
   - **IMPORTANT:** Overwrite the existing file
2. Navigate to `assets/js/` folder
3. Upload `lead-generation.js` (overwrite existing)
4. Upload `api-config.js` (overwrite existing)

**Step 5: Verify Upload**
- Check file sizes match local files
- Check modification dates are current
- Check file permissions (should be 644)

**Step 3: Upload Files**
1. Click "Upload" button at top
2. Select files from your computer:
   - `c:\Users\D\Documents\GitHub\capitalcitycontractors\index.html`
   - `c:\Users\D\Documents\GitHub\capitalcitycontractors\assets\js\lead-generation.js`
   - `c:\Users\D\Documents\GitHub\capitalcitycontractors\assets\js\api-config.js`
3. Wait for upload to complete (green checkmarks)

**Step 4: Verify Files**
1. Click on `index.html` → "Edit"
2. Search for `v=20250104k` (should find it in script tag)
3. If found, upload was successful!

### Method 3: Git Deployment (Advanced)

If your hosting supports Git deployment:

```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh user@capitalcitycontractors.ca

cd /path/to/public_html

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Verify files updated
ls -la assets/js/lead-generation.js
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Console Messages at All

2. Check file path in HTML: `assets/js/lead-generation.js`
3. Check file permissions (should be 644)
4. Check server error logs
5. Try uploading again

**Verify file exists:**
- Visit: `https://capitalcitycontractors.ca/assets/js/lead-generation.js`
- Should show JavaScript code (not 404 error)

### Issue: "EmailJS library NOT loaded" Error

**Cause:** EmailJS script not loading

**Solutions:**

### Issue: Old Version Still Loading

**Cause:** Aggressive caching

**Solutions:**
