ICON SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================

The desktop app needs icon files for different platforms.

REQUIRED FILES:
---------------
1. icon.png (512x512 or 1024x1024) - For Linux and as base
2. icon.ico (256x256) - For Windows
3. icon.icns (512x512) - For Mac

HOW TO CREATE ICONS:
--------------------

Option 1: Use Online Tool (Easiest)
- Go to: https://www.icoconverter.com/
- Upload your logo/image
- Download .ico, .icns, and .png versions
- Place in this assets/ folder

Option 2: Use Photoshop/GIMP
- Create 1024x1024 image
- Export as PNG
- Use online converter for .ico and .icns

Option 3: Use Icon Generator
- Go to: https://icon.kitchen/
- Upload image
- Generate all formats
- Download and place here

RECOMMENDED DESIGN:
-------------------
- Simple, recognizable logo
- High contrast
- Works at small sizes (16x16)
- Represents your brand
- Construction/contractor theme

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
-------------------
Until you have custom icons, the app will use default Electron icon.
The app will still work perfectly, just won't have custom branding.

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
[ ] icon.png - Not yet created
[ ] icon.ico - Not yet created  
[ ] icon.icns - Not yet created

Once you have these files, place them in this folder and rebuild the app.
