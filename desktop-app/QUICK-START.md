# ðŸš€ Quick Start - Build Your Desktop App in 5 Minutes

## What You're Building

A secure, password-protected desktop application (.exe) that runs your CRM offline on Windows.

---

## âš¡ Super Quick Steps

### 1. Install Node.js (One-Time Setup)

**Download:** https://nodejs.org/

- Click the big green "LTS" button
- Run the installer
- Click "Next" through everything
- **Restart your computer** after installation

**How to verify it worked:**
1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. Type `node --version` and press Enter
4. You should see something like `v18.17.0`

---

### 2. Open Command Prompt in the Right Folder

**Method A - Easy Way:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\GitHub\capitalcitycontractors\desktop-app`
3. Click in the address bar at the top
4. Type `cmd` and press Enter
5. Command Prompt opens in the right folder!

**Method B - Manual Way:**
1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. Type this command (adjust path to match your setup):
```bash
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\GitHub\capitalcitycontractors\desktop-app
```
4. Press Enter

---

### 3. Install Dependencies (One-Time)

In the Command Prompt, type:

```bash
npm install
```

Press Enter and wait 2-3 minutes. You'll see lots of text scrolling. This is normal!

**What this does:** Downloads Electron and build tools (about 200 MB)

---

### 4. Test the App (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
npm start
```

This opens the app so you can test it. You should see:
- Login screen
- Enter a password (anything you want)
- CRM loads

Close the app window when done testing.

---

### 5. Build the .exe

**IMPORTANT: Run Command Prompt as Administrator!**

1. Close your current Command Prompt
2. Press `Windows` key
3. Type `cmd`
4. **Right-click** on "Command Prompt"
5. Click **"Run as administrator"**
6. Click "Yes" when Windows asks for permission
7. Navigate to the folder again:
```bash
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\GitHub\capitalcitycontractors\desktop-app
```
8. Now run the build:
```bash
npm run build-win
```

Press Enter and wait 3-5 minutes. You'll see:
- "ðŸ”§ Setting up desktop app build..."
- "âœ… Copied crm-dashboard.js"
- "Building..." messages
- Progress bars
- "Done!" when finished

**What this creates:**
- `dist/Capital City Contractors CRM Setup 3.0.0.exe` (installer)
- About 150-200 MB file

**Why Administrator?** Windows requires admin privileges to create symbolic links during the build process.

**Note:** The build automatically copies the CRM files before building. If you update the CRM code, just run `npm run build-win` again to rebuild with the latest changes.

7. App installs to: `C:\Program Files\Capital City Contractors CRM\`
8. Desktop shortcut is created automatically
9. Click **"Finish"** to launch the app

**Note:** This is a local file on your computer, not a website URL!
