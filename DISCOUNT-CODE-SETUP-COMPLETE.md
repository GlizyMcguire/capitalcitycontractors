# ✅ Phase 1 Complete: Discount Code System - Setup Guide

## 🎉 What's Been Fixed

Your discount code system is now **production-ready**! Here's what was implemented:

### ✅ **Fixed Issues:**
1. **EmailJS Configuration** - Now using your existing EmailJS credentials
2. **Fraud Prevention** - Added address field with duplicate checking (1 code per household)
3. **Address Autocomplete** - Google Places API integration for address validation
4. **User Feedback** - Clear messaging about limits and better error handling
5. **Admin Dashboard** - Already exists! (see access instructions below)
6. **Email Tracking** - All codes are tracked with recipient details

---

## 📋 Setup Steps Overview

**Step 1**: Set up Google Places API (15 min) - See `GOOGLE-PLACES-API-SETUP.md` *(Optional but recommended)*
**Step 2**: Create EmailJS templates (15 min) - Instructions below
**Step 3**: Test the system (10 min) - Instructions below

**Total Time**: ~40 minutes

## 🚀 STEP 1 (OPTIONAL): Google Places API Setup

For **address autocomplete** functionality (validates real addresses as users type):

📄 **See detailed guide**: `GOOGLE-PLACES-API-SETUP.md`

**Quick summary:**
1. Get Google API key from https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Enable Places API
3. Add API key to `index.html` (line 168)
4. Test address autocomplete on your form

**Benefits**: Better fraud prevention, validated addresses, improved UX

**Note**: System works without this, but address validation is manual.

   - Name: Test Customer
   - Email: YOUR_EMAIL@example.com (use your real email to receive the test)
   - Phone: 613-555-0123

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If emails aren't sending:

1. **Check EmailJS Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://dashboard.emailjs.com/
   - Check "Email History" to see if emails were sent
   - Look for error messages

2. **Verify Template IDs**:
   - Customer template ID must be: `template_discount_welcome`
   - Business template ID must be: `template_discount_business`

3. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for error messages
   - You should see: "✅ Email sent successfully"

### If duplicate checking isn't working:

- The system normalizes addresses (removes punctuation, spaces, etc.)
- "123 Main St" = "123 Main Street" = "123 main st."
- This prevents simple workarounds
