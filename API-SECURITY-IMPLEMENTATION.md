# üîí API Security Implementation Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Understanding Client-Side API Security

**Reality Check:**
Your website is a **static site** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript only, no backend server). This means:
- ‚ùå API keys in client-side code are **always visible** to users
- ‚ùå Anyone can view your source code and see the keys
- ‚úÖ **BUT** we can implement restrictions to prevent abuse

**The Solution:**
We'll implement **API key restrictions** and **usage monitoring** to protect against unauthorized use.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Google Places API Key Protection

**Current Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Your API key is UNRESTRICTED (anyone can use it)

**CRITICAL: Restrict Your API Key NOW**

#### Step 1: Add Domain Restrictions

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console:**
   - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

2. **Find your API key:**
   - Look for key ending in `...Dr8`
   - Click the pencil icon (Edit)

3. **Set Application Restrictions:**
   - Select **"HTTP referrers (websites)"**
   - Click **"Add an item"**
   - Add these referrers:
     ```
     https://capitalcitycontractors.ca/*
     https://www.capitalcitycontractors.ca/*
     ```
   - (Optional for testing) Add: `http://localhost/*`

4. **Set API Restrictions:**
   - Select **"Restrict key"**
   - Check **ONLY** "Places API"
   - Uncheck all other APIs

5. **Click "Save"**

**Result:** ‚úÖ Your API key will ONLY work on your domain and ONLY for Places API

### 2. EmailJS Security Configuration

**Current Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è EmailJS credentials are visible (but this is normal)

**EmailJS is designed for client-side use** - the public key is meant to be visible.

#### Step 1: Restrict EmailJS to Your Domain

1. **Go to EmailJS Dashboard:**
   - https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin

2. **Click on "Security" or "Settings"**

3. **Add Allowed Origins:**
   ```
   https://capitalcitycontractors.ca
   https://www.capitalcitycontractors.ca
   ```

4. **Enable reCAPTCHA (if available):**
   - Adds bot protection
   - Prevents automated abuse

5. **Set Rate Limits:**
   - Limit emails per day/hour
   - Prevents spam attacks

**Result:** ‚úÖ EmailJS will only accept requests from your domain

---

### 3. Usage Monitoring & Alerts

#### Google Cloud Console Monitoring

1. **Set Up Billing Alerts:**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
   - Click "Budgets & alerts"
   - Create budget: $10/month
   - Set alert at 50%, 90%, 100%

2. **Monitor API Usage:**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard
   - Click "Places API"
   - View usage charts daily for first week

3. **Set Usage Quotas:**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/places-backend.googleapis.com/quotas
   - Set daily quota: 1,000 requests/day (adjust as needed)

#### EmailJS Monitoring

1. **Check EmailJS Dashboard:**
   - https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin
   - Monitor email count
   - Check for unusual activity

2. **Set Up Email Notifications:**
   - Get alerts when quota is reached
   - Monitor failed sends

### 4. Client-Side Rate Limiting

**Implemented in Code:**
- Prevents rapid-fire form submissions
- Adds delays between requests
- Tracks submission attempts

---

## üîê Additional Security Measures

### A. Content Security Policy (CSP)

Add to your `<head>` section in index.html:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://maps.googleapis.com https://cdn.emailjs.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://unpkg.com;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com;
    font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com;
    img-src 'self' data: https:;
    connect-src 'self' https://maps.googleapis.com https://api.emailjs.com;
">
```

### B. Subresource Integrity (SRI)

For external scripts, add integrity hashes to verify they haven't been tampered with.

### C. HTTPS Only

Ensure your site is ONLY accessible via HTTPS (not HTTP).

## üö® What to Do If Keys Are Compromised

### If Google API Key is Abused:

1. **Immediately Regenerate Key:**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Delete compromised key
   - Create new key with restrictions

2. **Update Your Website:**
   - Replace old key with new key
   - Deploy immediately

3. **Review Billing:**
   - Check for unexpected charges
   - Contact Google Cloud support if needed

### If EmailJS is Abused:

1. **Regenerate EmailJS Keys:**
   - Go to EmailJS dashboard
   - Create new service/template IDs
   - Update your code

2. **Enable Additional Security:**
   - Add reCAPTCHA
   - Tighten domain restrictions

## üìä Security Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Do Now):
- [ ] Restrict Google API key to your domain
- [ ] Restrict Google API key to Places API only
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud billing alerts ($10/month)
- [ ] Restrict EmailJS to your domain
- [ ] Set EmailJS rate limits

### Weekly Monitoring:
- [ ] Check Google Cloud Console for usage
- [ ] Check EmailJS dashboard for email count
- [ ] Review any failed requests
- [ ] Check for unusual patterns

### Monthly Review:
- [ ] Review Google Cloud billing
- [ ] Review EmailJS usage
- [ ] Check for security updates
- [ ] Verify restrictions are still in place

## üí° Understanding the Limitations

**What API Restrictions CAN Do:**
‚úÖ Prevent use of your key on other websites
‚úÖ Limit which APIs can be called
‚úÖ Set usage quotas
‚úÖ Alert you to unusual activity
‚úÖ Prevent most automated abuse

**What API Restrictions CANNOT Do:**
‚ùå Hide the key from users viewing your source code
‚ùå Prevent a determined attacker from copying your key
‚ùå Guarantee zero unauthorized use

**The Reality:**
- Client-side API keys are **always visible**
- Restrictions make abuse **difficult and limited**
- Monitoring helps you **catch abuse quickly**
- This is **standard practice** for static websites

## üöÄ Advanced Option: Serverless Proxy (Optional)

If you want **maximum security**, you can create a serverless function to proxy API calls:

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ API keys stored server-side (not visible)
- ‚úÖ Additional validation/rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Better control over requests

### Options:
1. **Netlify Functions** (if hosted on Netlify)
2. **Vercel Serverless Functions** (if hosted on Vercel)
3. **Cloudflare Workers** (works with any host)
4. **AWS Lambda** (more complex setup)

### Implementation:
Would require creating a backend function that:
1. Receives requests from your website
2. Validates the request
3. Calls Google/EmailJS APIs with server-side keys
4. Returns results to your website

**Cost:** Usually free tier available (100k-1M requests/month)

**Let me know if you want me to implement this!**
