    content_name: 'Quote Request',
    content_category: 'Quote Form',
    currency: 'CAD',
    value: 0.00
}, {
    eventID: 'quote_' + Date.now(),
    test_event_code: 'TEST42844'
});
```

### Event Parameters
- **Event Type:** `Lead` (Standard Facebook conversion event)
- **content_name:** "Quote Request"
- **content_category:** "Quote Form"
- **currency:** CAD (Canadian Dollars)
- **value:** 0.00 (can be updated later if you want to assign a value to leads)

## üîß Technical Details

### File Modified
- **File:** `capitalcitycontractors/assets/js/emailjs-integration.js`
- **Method:** `showSuccess()` (line 384-425)
- **Trigger:** Fires immediately after successful quote form submission

### Event Flow
1. User fills out quote form
2. Form is validated
3. Email is sent via EmailJS
4. **Meta Pixel Lead event fires** ‚Üê NEW
5. Success modal is displayed
6. Form is reset

### Error Handling
- If Meta Pixel (`fbq`) is not loaded, the event is skipped gracefully
- No impact on form submission if pixel fails
- Console warnings logged for debugging

### Deduplication
- Each event has a unique `eventID` (format: `quote_1234567890`)
- Prevents duplicate counting if the same event is sent multiple times
- Uses timestamp to ensure uniqueness

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

### Remove Test Event Code (After Verification)
Once you've confirmed the Lead event is working in Facebook Test Events, you should remove the test code for production:

1. Edit `assets/js/emailjs-integration.js`
2. Find line ~395 (in the `showSuccess()` method)
3. Change:
```javascript
fbq('track', 'Lead', {
    content_name: 'Quote Request',
    content_category: 'Quote Form',
    currency: 'CAD',
    value: 0.00
}, {
    eventID: 'quote_' + Date.now(),
    test_event_code: 'TEST42844'  // ‚Üê REMOVE THIS LINE
});
```

To:
```javascript
fbq('track', 'Lead', {
    content_name: 'Quote Request',
    content_category: 'Quote Form',
    currency: 'CAD',
    value: 0.00
}, {
    eventID: 'quote_' + Date.now()
});
```

**OR** simply let me know and I can remove it for you!

### Set Up Conversion Campaign
1. In Facebook Ads Manager, create a new campaign
2. Choose **"Leads"** as your campaign objective
3. In the ad set, select **"Lead"** as the conversion event
4. Facebook will now optimize to show ads to people most likely to submit quotes

### Create Custom Audiences
1. Go to Facebook Audiences
2. Create **"Website Custom Audience"**
3. Choose: **"People who took specific actions"**
4. Select: **"Lead"** event

6. Use for retargeting or lookalike audiences

### Assign Value to Leads (Optional)
If you want to track the monetary value of leads:
1. Estimate average customer lifetime value or project value
2. Update the `value` parameter in the code
3. Example: If average project is $5,000, set `value: 5000.00`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Lead Event Not Showing in Test Events?
1. **Wait 30-60 seconds** - there can be a delay
2. **Check browser console** for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
3. **Verify fbq is loaded**: Type `fbq` in console, should show function
4. **Disable ad blockers** - they may block the pixel
5. **Try incognito mode** - eliminates extension interference
6. **Check form submission** - make sure success modal appears

### "fbq is not defined" Error?
1. Verify Meta Pixel code is in the `<head>` section
2. Check Content Security Policy allows `connect.facebook.net`
3. Disable browser extensions temporarily
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### Event Shows But No Test Code?
1. Verify you're using the latest version of the code
2. Check that `test_event_code: 'TEST42844'` is in the event parameters
3. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Multiple Lead Events Firing?
1. This is normal if you submit multiple times
2. Each has a unique `eventID` to prevent duplicate counting
3. Facebook will deduplicate based on `eventID`
