- ‚ùå Anyone can view them in browser DevTools
- ‚ùå This is unavoidable for static websites

### What's Protected:
- ‚úÖ Keys only work on YOUR domain
- ‚úÖ Keys only work for specific APIs
- ‚úÖ Usage is limited and monitored
- ‚úÖ You're alerted to unusual activity

### The Reality:
- Client-side keys are always visible

- Monitoring catches abuse quickly
- This is standard for static sites
