// Drag a card from New to Qualified
// Check console for updates
```

### Test Duplicate Detection
```javascript
// Add a lead with same email as existing contact
// Should see: "Contact already exists: John Smith"
```

### Test Auto-Reminders
```javascript
// Manually set a lead's lastActivity to 4 days ago
window.crmDashboard.updateLead('lead_id_here', {
  lastActivity: new Date(Date.now() - 4 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString()
});
window.crmDashboard.render();
// Should see ⚠️ badge and auto-created task
```

### Test Auto-Tasks
```javascript
// Drag a lead to Estimate Sent
// Check tasks:
console.table(window.crmDashboard.tasks.filter(t => !t.completed));
